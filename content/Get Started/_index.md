## Back End Developers

Before you start, you may need to gain access to:

- [Client Extension](https://developers.directscale.com/docs/what-is-the-client-extension)
- [Public API](https://developers.directscale.com/docs/api-documentation-site-authorization)

After you're all set up and your code is ready to go, check out [how to deploy](https://developers.directscale.com/docs/deploying).

Much of the communication between your code and the Platform occurs with [Hooks](https://developers.directscale.com/docs/extension-hooks-reference-1). You also have the [Abstraction Layer](https://developers.directscale.com/docs/abstraction-layer), a public NuGet package that exposes many methods for you to use.
