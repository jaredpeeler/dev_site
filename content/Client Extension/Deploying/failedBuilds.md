If your deployment fails, then there were errors in your code.

![Failed builds link](https://lxteam.blob.core.windows.net/images/DevSite/ClientExtension/failed%20builds%20link.png)

Click the **Failed** link to open a modal where you can view the errors.

![Build Errors pop-up](https://lxteam.blob.core.windows.net/images/DevSite/ClientExtension/build%20errors%20popup.png)

Each error indicates the class and line number the error occurred at. Locate the errors in your code. When committed and ready to go, you can return to the **Deployment** page and [queue a new build](doc:deploying).
